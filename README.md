> This is a fork of the Neptune theme for Firefox. The original theme can be found at [yiiyahui/Neptune-Firefox](https://github.com/yiiyahui/Neptune-Firefox). Modifications primarily focus on further simplifying the interface by removing UI elements such as the back, forward, and new tab buttons.

## Installation

1. Follow the instructions on the upstream repository: [yiiyahui/Neptune-Firefox](https://github.com/yiiyahui/Neptune-Firefox).
2. Use the `chrome` folder from this repository to replace the one in the upstream repository.
3. Open "Customize Toolbar" and remove any buttons as desired.

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to support the original Neptune theme by giving it a star at https://github.com/yiiyahui/Neptune-Firefox!
